# 🎵 trackboxd — a letterboxd for Spotify

**trackboxd** is a web-only music companion app that brings the film-buff culture of Letterboxd to Spotify listeners. It lets users **rate**, **review**, and **annotate** songs, albums, and playlists — building a social layer on top of the Spotify experience.

You log in with your Spotify account, explore your music history, write timestamped thoughts on tracks (like SoundCloud comments), rate albums like Pitchfork, and create custom playlists that live on both trackboxd and Spotify.

## 📌 Core Idea

Spotify is for listening.  
**trackboxd is for reacting.**  
It gives you a home to express your taste, opinions, and deep takes on the music you love — while also seeing how others feel about the same tracks.
